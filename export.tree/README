Study explores the neural mechanisms underlying reactance in the persuasion process of assertive vs. non-assertive nutritional messages. Particularly, the more direct and forceful nature of assertive (vs. non-assertive) messages may elicit higher reactance and provoke persuasion resistance and hence activate to a greater extent brain regions linked to anger and counterarguing.
